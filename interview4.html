        <b>1.What is a Temporal Dead Zone?</b>
        <span>ans.the area of a block where a variable is inaccessible until the moment the computer completely initializes it with a value</span>
        
        
        <b>2.What is the for-in loop in JavaScript? Give its syntax</b>
        <span>ans.The JavaScript for in statement loops through the properties of an Object:
            for (key in object) {
                // code block to be executed
              }
              Each iteration returns a key (x)
              The key is used to access the value of the key
        </span>

        <b>3.Explain Local Scope, Block Scope, Functional Scope and Scope Chain in JavaScript?</b>
        <span>ans. <b>Local or Function Scope:</b>
            Variables that are declared inside a function or a method have Local or Function Scope.
            It means those variables or functions which are declared inside the function or a method can be accessed within that function only.
           <b>Block Scope:</b>
            Block Scope is related to the variables or functions which are declared using let and const since var does not have block scope.
            Block Scope tells us that variables that are declared inside a block { }, can be accessed within that block only, not outside of that block.
            <b>Scope Chain:</b>
            JavaScript engine uses scopes to find out the exact location or accessibility of variables and that particular process is known as Scope Chain.
            Scope Chain means that one variable has a scope (it may be global or local/function or block scope) is used by another variable or function having another scope (may be global or local/function or block scope).
            This complete chain formation goes on and stops when the user wishes to stop it according to the requirement.</span>
        
        
        
        
        <b>4.What is difference between null and undefined and where to use what?</b>
        <span>ans. In JavaScript, undefined is a type.
            whereas null an object.
            <i>undefined</i>:It means a variable declared, but no value has been assigned a value.
            <i>null</i>:null in JavaScript is an assignment value. You can assign it to a variable.
        </span>


        <b>5.what is Symbol?</b>
        <span>ans.Symbol is a primitive data type of JavaScript, along with string, number, boolean, null and undefined. 
            It was introduced in ECMAScript 2015, so just a few years ago. It's a very peculiar data type. 
            Once you create a symbol, its value is kept private and for internal use
        </span>

        <b>6.Write code to explain map and filter in arrays</b>
        <span>ans. both are methods of arrays
            map wont reduce the length of the original array.
            while filter can alter the size of the original array.
        </span>

        <b>7.Explain passed by value and passed by reference</b>
        <span>ans.The difference between pass-by-reference and pass-by-value is that modifications made to arguments passed in by reference in the called function
             have effect in the calling function, whereas modifications made to arguments passed in by value in the called function can not affect the calling function</span>

        <b>8.Please explain Self Invoking Function and its code</b>
        <span>ans.A self-invoking (also called self-executing) function is a nameless (anonymous) function that is invoked immediately after its definition.
             An anonymous function is enclosed inside a set of parentheses followed by another set of parentheses ()
            (function (){

            })()
            
            </span>

        <b>9.What is an event loop and call stack</b>
        <span>ans.The event loop is a constantly running process that monitors both the callback queue and the call stack. 
            If the call stack is not empty, the event loop waits until it is empty and places the next function from the callback queue to the call stack
